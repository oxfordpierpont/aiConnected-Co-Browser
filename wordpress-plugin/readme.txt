AI-powered co-browsing assistant that helps visitors navigate your website using natural conversation.

== Description ==

SiteGuide is an intelligent AI assistant that lives on your website and helps visitors find what they need. Unlike traditional chatbots, SiteGuide can actually control the page - scrolling to relevant sections, highlighting content, and guiding users through your site.

**Key Features:**

* **Natural Conversation** - Users can type or speak to the assistant in plain language
* **Smart Navigation** - AI automatically scrolls to and highlights relevant content
* **Voice Support** - Full voice input and output for hands-free interaction
* **Session Memory** - Remembers users across visits, even on different devices
* **Lead Capture** - Collects contact information naturally during conversation
* **Zero Code Required** - Just install, configure, and go

**How It Works:**

1. Install the plugin
2. Enter your Site ID from the SiteGuide dashboard
3. SiteGuide appears on your site and starts helping visitors

The assistant understands your page content and can guide users to pricing, FAQs, contact forms, or any other section - just like a human guide would.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/siteguide/` or install through the WordPress plugins screen
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Go to Settings → SiteGuide to configure the plugin
4. Enter your Site ID (get one at siteguide.io)
5. Save settings and you're done!
